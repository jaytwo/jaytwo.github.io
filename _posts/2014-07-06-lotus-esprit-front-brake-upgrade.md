### Tools

- 19mm socket and torque wrench

- 19mm spanner for the steering arm nuts

- 30mm socket for the hubs

- 15/32" socket for sliding pin bolts (optional but recommended)

- Flathead screwdrivers and pliers for levering

- Hydraulic jack and axle stands

### 1) Remove hubs

- Loosen the wheel nuts and jack the front of the car up onto stands

- Remove the front wheels

- Remove the two 19mm bolts attaching the caliper to the vertical link.  They're tight - you can use a socket on the lower, but the brake hose restricts socket access to the upper.  I used a 15/32" socket to remove the sliding pin bolt at the bottom of one caliper and swing it clear.  Alternatively, as it broke that socket, I just bent the hose bracket on the other caliper out of the way

- Tap a small flathead screwdriver around the edge of the cap to seperate it from the hub, and lever it off

- Remove the split pin at the end of the axle, new ones are supplied for refitting

- The seals, bearings and hub and disc assembly just pull out in order - there's a 30mm nut to undo but it's only hand tight, I didn't need a ratchet

### 2) Remove discs and shields

- Remove the 13mm and 19mm bolts attaching the heat shield to the vertical link.  Discard the shield, but re-attach the 19mm bolt for the steering arm
