It's raining, so I've decided to copy what I could off my remaining writeable CDs and DVDs and bin them.  I've been keeping a stack of blank media in reserve for a decade now, and haven't used one since I last installed Windows.

Half are partially or fully unreadable now.  While my drive struggles to rescue the ones and zeros I thought I'd list the physical media formats I've personally owned in the past, and how many I'm still using:

### Video (and data)

- DVD
- <s>DVD-R/RW</s>
- <s>VHS</s>

### Audio (and data)

- CD
- <s>CD-R/RW</s>
- <s>Sony MiniDisc (my stepfather was a musician)</s>
- <s>Compact Cassette</s>

### Data

- Hard disc drive
- USB flash drive
- Secure Digital card
- <s>CompactFlash, SmartMedia, Memory Stick and MultiMediaCard</s>
- <s>Iomega Zip drive</s>
- <s>ROM cartridge</s>
- <s>3Â½-inch floppy disc</s>
- <s>3-inch floppy disc</s>

Blu-ray and solid-state drives are pretty established now, threatening my DVD and hard disc collections.  But it's the network that's killing the data media stars.
