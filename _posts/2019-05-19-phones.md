I broke yet another phone today, so I've decided to list the Android phones I've had to try and remember what I like for the next one:

-- **UMI Super** 5.5" 1920 x 1080, 2Ghz, 185g
Liked the strong metal body and coloured notification ring.
Disliked the weight and lack of UK charger.
Killed by a canal.

-- **Sony Xperia Z3 Compact** 4.6" 1280 x 720, 2.5Ghz, 129g
Liked the amazingly precise touchscreen.
Disliked the glass/plastic body and small screen.
Killed by dropping.  Hated this phone, inexplicably.

-- **HTC One Max** 5.9" 1920 x 1080, 1.7Ghz, 217g
Liked the big screen and smooth performance.
Disliked the unreliable plastic buttons.
Killed by frame failure.

-- **Sony Xperia SP** 4.6" 1280 x 720, 1.7Ghz, 155g
Liked the ridiculous notification light and light weight.
Disliked the small screen and vulnerable plastic body.
Survived!  Sold with no defects other than loads of scratches to the plastic.

-- **Samsung Galaxy Ace** 3.5" 480 x 320, 830Mhz, 113g
Liked the light weight and decent build quality.
Disliked the low resolution and old software.
Killed by losing on a ski slope.
