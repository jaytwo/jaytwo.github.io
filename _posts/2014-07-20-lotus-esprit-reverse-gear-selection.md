Gear changing has never been good on my Esprit - stick travel is huge and pretty vague, and fetching reverse became something even garage mechanics couldn't do without advice.  Things got even worse when the [clutch stopped fully disengaging](//blog/archives/2014/06/17/lotus-esprit-clutch-hose-replacement).

There are two problems areas here - the bushes at the base of the stick, and the joints and bearings in the translator above the exhaust silencer.  Both are expected to be completely worn after 100k miles, which I've more than clocked.

I lost reverse completely yesterday and decided to look at the translator today.  It wasn't quite as bad to get to as I've read, possibly because I've a smaller aftermarket silencer fitted, but I expect I'll be cursing anyway when I have to fully dismantle it.  Here's a subsection of a photo I found on the web of someone else's translator, taken with the boot floor removed:

Forward and backward motion of the gear stick moves both cables and the translator forward and back, rotating the cross shaft heading toward the gearbox.

Sideways motion of the gear stick causes differences in cable length, rotating the translator around the end of the tie rod at the bottom of the photo, moving it and the shaft laterally.

The translator floats using 4 ball joints and 2 sets of bearings - all exposed to heat, moisture and road muck.  Mine are all ruined (the outer end of my tie rod only seems to be sitting on the ball because of gravity!) and I shall be ordering one of several repair kits available, but in the meantime, I did notice that the wear and tear on the tie rod had effectively shortened it ever-so-slightly.

This meant I had a little more movement available than I needed to enter fifth gear, but not enough to enter reverse.

You can remove the tie rod fairly easily with a 10mm spanner on the base of each ball and a 10mm socket on an extension.  This is easy if you rotate the translator forward to point past the silencer, engaging 3rd or 4th gear (I'm quite sure which direction's which longitudinally).

After inserting a washer into my tie rod (it was too seized to adjust properly, and I'm replacing it anyway) I had reverse back!  But seeing the state of this setup made me realise my gearshift is at the very end of its life, and I'm looking forward to the difference replacement components make.
