A few weeks ago, I decided the unpredictable once-per-day subsidised bus service home was adding more stress to my life than it was worth to commute on, and to find another way.

Having failed in 2 years to make the simple half-mile journey to the nearby gym, I decided to get a bicycle and tackle two problems together.  Here are some notes on what I came up with:

- **Folding bicycle** - After reading [reviews](http://www.atob.org.uk/folding-bikes/folding-bike-buyers-guide-uk/) I snapped up a barely-used [Dahon Speed D7](http://dahon.com/mainnav/foldingbikes/single-view/bike/speed_d7-6.html).  I like the less-tiny 20" wheels and the 12.5kg weight can be carried short distances, but the saddle clamp wears too much to risk the smallest folding size often.

- **Helmet** - I know nothing about these, but a display [Giro Foray](http://www.giro.com/eu_en/foray.html/) adjusted easily  to fit.  That saved me requesting staff help to try different sizes of other models, which seemed as bad a prospect as sequentially requesting shoes in a shoe shop until you buy your last (and worst) choice out of desperation.  It's light, but the straps meets the side of your head edge-on, which seems odd.

- **Lights** - [iNFiNi I-260's](http://www.infini.tw/product/detail.php?&c=11&p=83&l=en&mode=1) are ultra-lightweight at only 15 grams each and rechargeable via micro-USB, which is very practical at work.  Brightness is pretty minimal compared to alternatives though - I can't see far ahead in the unlit sections of my ride at night.

- **Lock** - The Dahon lives in my bedroom at home and an access-controlled room at work, so I just got the cheapest cable lock from [Kryptonite](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/).  It has a handy 'carrying solution' (although I leave the lock at work) but doesn't feel solid and is fussier to fit and remove than a U-lock.

- **Clothing** - I started by carrying a small backpack with glasses, a coat, gloves, allen keys and a hi-vis vest in.  October temperatures and plenty of rain keep things cool, but just a fleece and gloves do me now, both of which normally end up on the luggage rack halfway home.
