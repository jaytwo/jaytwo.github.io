excerpt: "Had too much fluid leaked, or had the infamous red hose expanded in the summer heat?  Only one way to be sure..."

The couple of weekends before last, it became rapidly more difficult to engage most gears on the Esprit, bordering impossible for first and reverse when stopped.  Embarrassing crunching and grinding of gear teeth alerted everyone else to my plight.

The weather has been warming up and searching reveals suspicion that the long red plastic original clutch hose can soften with age and expand in the heat.  This results in only partial clutch disengagement, meaning you're attempting to engage gears with the clutch still active.

I'm told it should take about 3 hours to do this, but I burned up that time just bleeding it!

### Parts

- Replacement hose kit.  I used a Goodridge 600-series from [Esprit Engineering](http://espritengineering.co.uk), which promotes faster response with a large bore.  Geoff supplies it without the fittings attached to the slave end, this is important to easily send it through the chassis grommets

- DOT 4 fluid, I used most of a litre

### Tools

- 13mm and 15mm spanners for hose fittings

- 13mm socket and torque wrench for slave cylinder mounting bolts

- 11mm spanner and socket for bleeding

- Small (electrical flathead) screwdriver for prising bleed nipple off, hose braiding open

- A second human, or a bleed kit, for bleeding.  I used a Gunson Eezibleed

- A bucket or tray, container for waste fluid

- Kitchen roll or rags for spills

- Stanley knife, drill, string, rigid wire and duck tape to make a 'tracer' when pulling the old hose out

- A few cable ties, cutters to remove the old ones

- Hydraulic jack and axle stands

### 1) Free the slave

- Jack the rear of the car up onto stands.  Higher is better - hand space is fairly good around the gearbox but I did this in the garage and found my body movement hampered by the sills

- The slave is on the right-hand side of the gearbox, look for the red hose leading to it.  Check you can slacken the 11mm bleed screw above the hose - you can get a socket on it here if it's stuck

- Remove the two 13mm bolts holding the slave cylinder in place, and pull it out.  The rod isn't attached to anything and will fall out.  The rubber boot can fit through the hole, but we'll want it off later anyway and it's easy to refit

- Dangle the slave by the hose and inspect it.  It's a Land Rover part easily replaced if leaking

### 2) Remove red hose

- When you're ready, sever the hose close to the slave.  This will let you use a socket on the slave fitting, and pull the hose without removing grommets.  Not much fluid should spill, but be prepared, and keep the slave openings topside when handling

- Empty as much fluid as possible from the hose on the car.  I forgot to do this and made a mess on the floor.  I imagine loosening the hose under the bonnet (next to the brake booster) would help if you can catch spillage from both ends

- Attach the string to the hose.  I used the knife and drill to puncture the side of the hose 1cm from the end (it's hard shiny plastic) and hooked the wire through it, making a loop for the string

- You won't be able to pull the whole hose out the car if you've only lifted the rear, but you should be able to pull it out the engine bay, and lift it out of a couple of the clips along the side of the box spine under the passenger compartment (they're not tight).  You'll need to cut some cable ties, so make a note of where they were, and make sure the string is remembering the hose's path

- Lower the rear of the car if you need to and raise the front onto stands

- Feed the last of the hose through the grommets at the front, and retrieve from the bonnet compartment, leaving the string behind.  Be careful with spillage, there's bodywork all around

### 3) Fit braided hose

- Begin by attaching the string to the unfitted end of the new hose.  I tied a knot near the end of the string and fed it into the hose until the knot blocked the entrance, then duck taped it

- Using the string to guide you back, push the hose through the grommet in the bonnet compartment.  The grommet after passing the steering rack requires a 90-degree turn - you won't make it without getting under the car, but there's plenty of space to get your hands near.  Going through the box section is harder - you'll be grateful not to have fittings on the hose

- Secure the top of the hose to the master cylinder and pull the slack through.  Clip what you can reach onto the box spine underneath the car

- Lower the front of the car and raise the rear onto stands again

- Feed the hose back through the engine bay following the string, until the end is near the slave cylinder area.  Re-apply the cable ties cut during removal, paying particular attention to ensuring that the hose can't foul engine belts

- Remove the string, and attach the hose end fitting as per the kit instructions

- Attach the hose to the slave.  Geoff supplied a flat rather than tapered adapter to prevent cracking the casting of the slave.  I struggled to stop this leaking, but filing the slave surface flat and using one of the copper washers included is the correct approach.  I found it easiest to check for leaks with the slave re-attached to the car, but I found bleeding it in that position totally ineffective, so ensure you leave it dangling again by the end

### 4) Bleed

- The clutch hydraulic system is just two cylinders, one of which contains the header tank, and a hose.  That said, I found it a total bugger to bleed.  I'm no expert so I'm only giving tips in this section - seek more authoritative advice if you're unsure

- Against practicality, hang the slave by the hose.  Air can collect at the far end of it in the normal position and whilst pushing the end in manually generates sloshing noises in that scenario, it doesn't seem to evict the trapped bubbles

- I was worried about using too much pressure when bleeding and ruining the bonnet area if I had a leak, but you can't bleed at low pressure, air traps just won't fill.  My bleed nipple didn't do anything when loosened and even removed, so I had to pump the clutch pedal with the bleed kit still attached to clear the blockage and get things started.  Beware blowing the kit off the header tank if doing this

- Toward the end of bleeding, depress the slave cylinder a few times (push inside the end where the rod had been) to dislodge air sitting inside the cylinder body

- You have to reattach it to the gearbox to test, but if you get all this right, you should have only a few millimetres of free play on the pedal and then a firm clutch, getting firmer as during depression.  If you're unsure, it's probably not bled exhaustively - I spent an astonishing 3 evenings getting this right, but it's worth it!
