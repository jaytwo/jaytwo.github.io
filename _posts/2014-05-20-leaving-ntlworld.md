Anyone remember NTLworld?

![NTLworld logo](/assets/posts/ntlworld_com.gif)

NTL provided cable internet access at my university campus in 2001, and I used their webspace to host a small site.  One of the <s>customer retention</s> security features of the FTP server was that it only allowed connections from NTL lines.

I forgot to take the site down after leaving campus, and it's been a top Google result for my name ever since.  NTL and Telewest merged to become Virgin Media in 2006 and despite eventually phoning a human being there I was unable to close the account.

The other day, I remembered I had access to a computer on a Virgin Media cable connection!  But the old NTLworld server still refused my connection:

Fortunately, I found this thread on the Virgin Media community forums:
