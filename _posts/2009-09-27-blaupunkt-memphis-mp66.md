excerpt: "I wouldn't recommend this unit."

I have a Blaupunkt Memphis MP66 CD player in my car. I bought it 2 or 3 years ago, and chose it because it has a colour TFT screen - a cross between a tiny widescreen laptop and a mobile phone.

The screen is attractive and easy to read, and the faceplate is well built - I've dropped it, stood on it, got it wet and thrown it around and it still looks good and works well.

But I wouldn't recommend this unit.  For starters, the internal amp overheated and started burning the paint off the mount while I was driving along without even being on.  I ignored the smell of burning - it's only after I saw smoke that I performed a desperate toolless dismantling of my centre console in Ludlow high street to prevent my car going up in flames.

Needless to say, that part of the unit doesn't work any more - I have to use an external amp instead.  On the plus side, everything else still works despite both the heat it suffered and the subsequent impact with the pavement after my scared female passenger threw it into the ground.  I don't see her much now.

That might have been unlucky.  It might also be unlucky that the LaCie 40Gb hard drive it shipped with developed bad sectors and became unusable after a year's rather average service.  It might even be unlucky that my other external hard drive, mobile phone memory card and 4-in-1 USB card reader all provoke a few seconds' of nothing followed by the blunt response "Device Error" when I try to use them with it.

But it's not bad luck that the CD player skips for every microscopic amoeba-bite-sized scratch in a disc.  My older Kenwood CD player never missed a beat in all its 2-year lifespan.

And it's not bad luck that when it skips the unit plays the misread data anyway - a violent maximum-volume interruption of random digital noise.

And it's not bad luck that to adjust the bass I have to press Menu, then Audio Settings, then Bass before I can even start.  The same for the treble.  The equaliser's another 2 layers deeper.  My dad's Goodman's cassette radio has two sliders physically present on the front of the unit - that's how important these functions should be.

And it's downright dangerous that despite a wonderful screen and six buttons to use it with, the blue-on-orange on-screen descriptions for the buttons are completely unreadable from a driving position.  Amateur stuff, Blaupunkt.  Your hardware guys (CD-player and flaming amp aside) did some neat work, your software guys let the side down.

Here's a kicker for when I'm down -I bought a new 4Gb SD card to use with the SD card slot today, to avoid playing the National Lottery-like USB compatibility odds.  I say SD card - it happens to have 'HC' written beneath the normal SD logo.  Turns out most SD cards over 1Gb are SDHC - the original SD design has to be bent a bit to go over 1Gb, and can't exceed 4Gb at all - not very useful for a proper music library. Anyway, looks the same - in it goes.

Doesn't work at all. Not even "Device Error". Having checked the difference between SDHC and SD over at Wikipedia, I was aware that a tiny software update might be needed - SDHC wasn't around when the MP66 was being drawn up.

Do you offer one Blaupunkt software guys? Predictably, absolutely not.

Do you think I'll buy from you again? Predictably, absolutely not.

Bad design annoys me, especially in software, where it's so avoidable. I've been doing a lot of reading about how to strive for better - I'll share some of my favourite thoughts another time.

I plugged an eighties Panasonic radio-turntable I bought today at a boot-sale into a nineties Kenwood amp I bought off eBay last year. Worked straight away as you know it would.

Is technology really making life easier? I think overall it's two steps forward for every one back, and I think that ratio's going to get better. It's our generation that's going to learn how to make it so.
