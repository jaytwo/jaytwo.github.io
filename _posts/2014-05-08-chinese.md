excerpt: "The extent of my Chinese.  I can't make many sentences."
---

I've been in Taiwan for nearly three weeks now, visiting good friends here that I naturally don't see often at the moment.

Below is the extent of my Chinese.  I can't make many sentences.

### Written

Mouth - 口 (part of the translation for Exit, and other mouths in the general, rather than biological, sense) 

Mountain - 山 (Shān, often part of place names, when they are mountains!)

Tall - 高 (I do not remember why I know this)

Person - 人 (like a pair of walking legs!) 

### Verbal

Hello - Nǐ hǎo

Okay - Hǎo (people say this a lot on the phone, a bit like 'uh-huh' or 'yes')

Thank you - Xièxiè, variously pronounced but often as 'she she-eh' as far as I can tell.  Tricky to sound natural at even to my Chinese-deaf ears

### Food

Dàn - Egg

Luobogao - Possibly the correct spelling of something I remember as 'Robogau'.  A word I like due to its similarity to 'Robocop' but don't remember exactly what it refers to.

Mantou - A steamed bun, sometimes with something else hiding inside.  Lovely hot, can be stodgy when cold.
