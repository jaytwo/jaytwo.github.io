excerpt: "I suddenly understand the male stereotype for forgetting anniversaries."

I met my girlfriend 2 months ago, maybe longer now.  If she remembers more accurately than I do, I hope she forgives me for not knowing.

I suddenly understand the male stereotype for forgetting anniversaries.  I always thought it was something to do with romantic thoughts ranking pretty low in our to-do lists.

But it's not that we can't remember dates, it's that we never realised the significance of the date to remember it.  By the time you know an event was significant, you've forgotten when it took place.

I used to run a calendar. That would have solved that little problem. Maybe my theory above isn't correct at all.
