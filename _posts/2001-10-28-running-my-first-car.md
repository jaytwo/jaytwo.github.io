#### 02/07 - Day 0 - Purchase, In-Car Entertainment

Purchased the car for **£100** and a third-hand keyboard (musical instrument).

![Volvo 340 GLE](/assets/posts/Volvo_340a.jpg)

Picked up a JVC 4x40W CD-Radio (**£100**) to sit in the centre console.  The console slot looks like someone cut it themselves with a Stanley knife - nonetheless, unit fits fine and works with the two door speakers.
 
#### 03/07 - Day 1 - Insurance/Tax/MoT

Took out insurance policy, which, with my being an under-25 bloke with no significant NCD proved to be rather expensive.  Wallet lightened by more than **£1k**.

#### 07/07 - Day 5 - Damage

Shaking badly whilst driving at the 20mph mark.  Further inspection of rear o/s tyre reveals buckled wheel, tyre almost destroyed.  Wheel changed for spare until a replacement can be found.

#### 09/07 - Day 7 - In-Car Entertainment

Completed manufacture (from raw MDF boards) of a bass-box setup for the boot, manufactured from a pair of 10-inch speaker cones that were once part of my home setup.  Many thanks to my brother for the work he put in - he’s a far better carpenter than I am.  Cost of wood : **£16**.

#### 14/07 - Day 12 - Repair, Exterior Styling

Went to scrappie to find a replacement wheel and tyre, found and purchased for a tenner.  Whilst up there, salvaged GLS radiator grille, boot spoiler, a bumper bolt cover, and some replacement interior trim.  Spoiler not Volvo manufactured, a pain to fit.  Nonetheless, job complete : total cost for the day, **£25**.

#### 21/07 - Day 19 - Exterior Styling

Went to town and picked up a set of hub caps.  Hadn’t checked the wheel sizes, somewhat disappointed to discover that the standard steels are only 13” in diameter.  Quick style-up though - cost : **£19.99**.

#### 04/08 - Day 33 - Repair

Picked up a can of white primer at a local hardware store, heavy duty grade.  Fail to find paint, so trek off to Halfords, where ‘Volvo Deep Blue’ provides a possibly too approximate match.  Treat largest rust patch on rear n/s door.  **£13**.

#### 08/09 - Day 88 - MoT Failure

MoT test taken - failed on O/S/R Foglamp (inoperative), O/S/F and N/S/F headlights (beam high), handbrake (low effort, excessive travel, N/S/R brake binding), rear tyres (worn), seatbelts (N/S/F sill rusted), emissions (CO2 at 8.02% - too high), bodywork (N/S/F bumper insecure), front number plate (cracked).  **£17** for the news.

#### 13/09 - Day 93 - Damage
 
Cracked my driver-side mirror and lost the N/S/F hub cab driving back from work along a narrow country lane.

#### 15/09 - Day 95 - Repair, Exterior Styling

Visit to scrappie yields a replacement mirror, and new choke lever - mine had not been staying out.  Upon replacement the cause became obvious - the lever was badly bent and had cracked the casing.  Replacement hub cabs from a discount store a considerably tighter fit than previous set - at half the price.  Total cost for the day : **£19.99**.

#### 16/09 - Day 96 - Repair

One week later, with a week to go before the garage start work, decide to limit my losses and repair part of it myself.  Fixed rear fog lamp (loose contact), beam adjustment, tyres (by swapping them around and putting the spare on - you’ll see why later), front bumper (using a self-tapping screw to replace the broken clip), and number plate (replacement).  Total cost - **£0** excluding number plate - way to go, me.

#### 22/09 - Day 102 - MoT Failure

Car returned to garage for emissions, welding and handbrake.  Car returned to me 9 hours later with a responsive handbrake and correct emissions output, but the sill is severely rotted and needs replacing. All my own repairs pass the test, including the tyres.  No cost for MoT update, but bill for repair is **£85.18**.

#### 27/09 - Day 107 - Damage

Minor radiator leaks previously troubling me suddenly explode, on my penultimate day at work.  Radiator empty, losing water at the rate of full-to-empty (8.0 litres) in less than 20 minutes, a litre every 150 seconds.  Unable to take the critical last days off work, I drive around carrying 12 litres of water in bottles, stopping every 10 minutes, with the engine coughing badly from overheating.

#### 29/09 - Day 109 - Repair

Obtain a new radiator locally for **£100.09** and fit myself before making the 160-mile round-trip to Chelmsford and back.  Works a treat, but engine damaged - unable to idle with any less than half choke, and coughing badly at low throttle.

#### 01/10 - Day 112 - Repair, Insurance/Tax/MoT 

Back into garage for new sill and MoT - takes them right up until minutes from closing time to fit it.  A modest £85.

#### 02/10 - Day 113 - Internal Styling, External Styling

Over the last month I’d been struggling to keep the car going, but now, damaged engine excluded, the car is smooth again with a year’s MoT sitting pretty in the glovebox.  Whilst up scrappie spot pristine 360GLT just got in - an extremely rare oppurtunity!  However, only 1hr 15mins left till closing time, and am leaving town next day for beginning of term at uni 100 miles away in Southampton.  What to do?

Help myself to driver and passenger floor pans, console cassette rack, ‘Volvo’ branded CD-radio slot for the console to replace my knifed-out one, a new cigarette lighter, and the GLT leather-centred steering wheel - nice touch.  1hr to go - start on the alloy wheels present.  Nuts on wheels badly distorted, have to almost smash them to pieces to get the wheels off.  Tyres consist of 2 brand-new tyres with loads of tread, 2 well-used but good rear tyres, and one reasonable spare.  Took whole hour to remove, but well worth it.  Throw away distorted nuts, paid in full, and drove off on them.  Treat myself to a shiny new gear knob in celebration, and drive home **£84.99** less well-off, but very satisfied.

#### 07/10 - Day 118 - Repair

Stuck in a hailing gale at a retail centre with steamed up windows because the fan doesn’t work.  Run into Curry’s and get some wire, link up with a switch obtained earlier - an hour later (due to appalling weather) the fan is blowing good and hard.  Cost : **£3**.

#### 09/10 - Day 120 - Damage / Collision

Whilst sitting in traffic, I get rammed by drunk reversing off of the park (why?!).  Short car chase ensues, but cities are bad for such activity.  Reported to police, but front o/s wing damage nonetheless remains.
 
#### 13/10 - Day 124 - Repair, Exterior Styling 

My brother and I tackle the car together - him hammering out the front panel while I tend to a few things and remove the rubber strips from the doors.  Works well on driver side, but rips off paint on passenger side (where paintwork is bad anyway).
 
#### 14/10 - Day 125 - Damage
 
Cruising back from Hastings to Southampton, any use of lights causes ‘rear foglamp’ and ‘rear window demister’ lights to come on.  Appalled to see scrambling of my indicating and braking light systems - decide to keep car off the road until I fix it.
 
#### 20/10 - Day 131 - Repair 

After making a few very short journeys in the car, take it to the beach to sort out lights.  A bolt lost during the spoiler installation fouls the boot handle, locking it shut.  2 hours and one bodged earth lead later, both problems are sorted.
 
#### 24/10 - Day 135 - Exterior Styling 

Having found a better spray paint option (although still not perfect) here in the city, proceed to body-colour the front halves of the door mirrors.  Paint cost : **£4.99**.
 
#### 26/10 - Day 137 - Interior Styling
 
Making more use of that paint, proceed to spray side window vents on dash.  Adds a touch of ‘done-up’-ness to the otherwise very dull dash.  Notice that the long distance driving has cured the engine problems.

#### 27/10 - Day 138 - Exterior Styling 

Just can’t get enough of that paint - spray the bonnet air grille, and the radiator grille.  Preserved Volvo and GLS logo’s by removing before spray.  Upon re-fitting, note that GLS grille still does not fit exactly onto GLE, slightly inset - will have to adjust at some point.

#### 28/10 - Day 139 - Exterior Styling

Go bigger than before with paint and body-colour up the front bumper and bolt covers.  Run a little bit short of paint towards the end - cover is good for now, but probably a bit thin to last.  Also commence de-badging and de-lining of bootlid and driver door.
